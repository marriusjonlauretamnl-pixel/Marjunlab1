  <h1>The Best Movies According to Marrius Jon Laureta</h1>
<h2>My top 10 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3> Return to Silent Hill</h3>
<p>Should you rewatch “Silent Hill,” the exceptionally good live-action 2006 video game adaptation, before checking out “Return to Silent Hill,” a narratively unrelated sequel based on the popular “Silent Hill 2” game? Yes and no, though for the same reason: the first “Silent Hill” movie, a creepy and atmospheric mood piece directed by the still largely unsung journeyman Christophe Gans (“Brotherhood of the Wolf”), holds up really well. </p>

<h3>Mother of Flies</h3>
<p>“Mother of Flies,” about a father and daughter who get tangled up with a faith healer in a remote woodland area, is a family movie, but not in the way the phrase is usually used. It’s a nightmare parable about mortality, grief, faith, and the fragility of the flesh, made by one of the most fascinating filmmaking teams in American cinema, the Adams-Poser family.</p>

<h3>The Wizard of Oz</h3>
<p>As a child I simply did not notice whether a movie was in color or not. The movies themselves were such an overwhelming mystery that if they wanted to be in black and white, that was their business. It was not until I saw “The Wizard of Oz” for the first time that I consciously noticed B&amp;W versus color, as Dorothy was blown out of Kansas and into Oz. What did I think? It made good sense to me</p>

<h3>Sinners</h3>
<p>Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” did something that had never been done before Thursday morning: It was nominated for 16 Oscars. The previous record was held by “Titanic,” “All About Eve,” and “La La Land,” which all notched 14. Yes, there was a new category this year (Casting) and that helped but “Sinners” added an extra nomination over the previous record just to destroy that talking point.</p>

<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>“Avengers: Endgame” is the culmination of a decade of blockbuster filmmaking, the result of years of work from thousands of people. It is designed to be the most blockbuster of all the blockbusters, a movie with a dozen subplots colliding, and familiar faces from over 20 other movies. It’s really like nothing that Hollywood has produced before, existing not just to acknowledge or exploit the fans of this series, but to reward their love, patience, and undying adoration. The blunt thing you probably want to know most: It’s hard to see serious MCU fans walking away from this disappointed. It checks all the boxes, even ticking off a few ones that fans won’t expect to be on the list. It’s a satisfying end to a chapter of blockbuster history that will be hard to top for pure spectacle. In terms of sheer entertainment value, it’s on the higher end of the MCU, a film that elevates its most iconic heroes to the legendary status they deserve and provides a few legitimate thrills along the way.</p>

<h3>Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
<p>For a 160-minute epic that unifies a far-flung superhero universe that took a decade to build, packs 76 characters into one story, and has four to six plotlines cooking at any given time, “Avengers: Infinity War” hangs together pretty well. The plot finds the intergalactic bad guy Thanos (Josh Brolin) and his army of Green Goblin-looking warriors bouncing from star system to star system, torturing and killing various adversaries in order to gather six super-powerful Infinity Stones and embed them in Thanos’ oversized glove. Once he’s collected all six, Thanos will be able to achieve his dream of wiping out half the population of the universe in order to preserve its precious resources and restore “balance.” The only thing standing in his way are the Avengers, led by Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) and the rest. Plus all the characters from “Black Panther.” And the ones from “Guardians of the Galaxy.” And a few more Marvel characters who are new to this film.</p>

<h3>The Pitt</h3>
<p>The team behind HBO’s “The Pitt” probably knew they had something special, but even they had to be shocked by the remarkable success of one of the best shows of 2025. It turns out that not only is there still life in the medical drama, but that treating the profession seriously, rather than just using it for melodramatic network TV, is a route to the hearts and minds of viewers.</p>

<h3>Stranger Things</h3>
<p>When Netflix announced a unique release schedule for the final season of “Stranger Things” that sees the final season of the juggernaut hit split into three releases on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Eve, it felt like a brash pronouncement of their pop culture dominance. There are few shows that could get away with competing with the holidays, but few shows have been as prominent as the creation of the Duffer brothers, even if arguably too much of the conversation has pivoted to the age of the stars over the plotting of the show. Will the decision pay off? Probably. By the time the second volume of the fifth and final season of “Stranger Things” drops after sunset on Christmas Day, most people are ready for something non-holiday, and the real fans of the show, especially those who overlooked all the flaws of the first volume last month, are more excited to see how this story ends than to see what Santa brought them this year.</p>

<h3>Heated Rivalry</h3>
<p>From “Overcompensating” to “Boots,” this year has seen many queer television shows enter the cultural zeitgeist. Despite how good both of these shows are, they, like most queer shows of this decade, are unfortunately lacking the audaciousness found in the age of new queer cinema, packaged into perfectly quaint and safe representations of queer sexuality. Save for AMC’s “Interview with the Vampire” and Showtime’s “Fellow Travelers,” for the last few years, the progression of queer television has been stifled by creators who aren’t up to the challenge, forcing their protagonists into a sexless box that stifles the impact these shows could have on an industry that grows more conservative each year. </p>

<h3>Resident Evil: Retribution</h3>
<p>I resisted the “Resident Evil” movies for years. Too many years. I loved the first one when I was a teenager; it had beautiful women fighting zombies and a 12-year-old is easy to please like that. But during the heyday of the “Resident Evil” discourse I was on the sidelines, certain these movies couldn’t be as smart or interesting as people made them out to be. I was quite wrong. The people who for years had been positing these films as queer masterworks, and fascinating studies of motion and dissections of gender norms through bodies, attitudes, and clothes, were 100% right.  </p>
